# Bioinformatics Projects

A collection of my mini bioinformatics projects for learning purposes with the links to their repositories:
1. [Identifying Poor Quality Sequencing Cycles and Corresponding Bases from DNA Sequencing Reads](https://github.com/n-shenoy/identify-poor-quality-sequencing-cycles-and-bases)
2. [Visualizing genotypic (single-nucleotide polymorphism) variation across different Asian population groups](https://github.com/n-shenoy/asian-genome)
3. [Finding the origin of replication in E. coli](https://github.com/n-shenoy/dnaa-box-ecoli)
